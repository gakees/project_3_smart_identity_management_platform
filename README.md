# Smart Identity Management Platform (SIMPL)

##SMART IDENTITY


Identification of an individual or an asset is key to recognize someone. And in today’s world of digitization the most efficient way of having this record is in a digital form as well as to save ourselves from the potential issue of Identity  theft. The digitization of ID documents have manifold benefits right from the risk of being stolen , damaged, to Go Green as well. 

Today, our identity data are held by individual organizations as we engage offline and online. Often, data is poorly integrated and out of date. This duplication is error prone and inefficient, too.

There ought to be a simpler way to maintain our identity, with a master identity records. 

Here we intend to give this concern a resolution and adopt a way of digitizing our Identity documents like passport, driver’s license , social security card, Insurance card and the likes.

In order to do so our first step would be to create a non fungible token id for these respective assets

We then intend to build a smart contract using Solidity and put this in a blockchain transaction to make it secure and tamper proof

We will have an User Interface created using Streamlit for users to input their options and be directed to the specific ID/Asset link
